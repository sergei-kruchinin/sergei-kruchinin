## Mutual Follow Policy
 
I appreciate every follow and would like to follow back. However, due to a significant influx of spammers who follow only to later unfollow and artificially boost their rating, please confirm your intent via email. If confirmed, I will gladly follow you back. I consider following only to unfollow as manipulative behavior and actively monitor such actions. See [Stop-GitHub-Spammers](https://github.com/sergei-kruchinin/stop-gh-spammers) - a tool for detecting and dealing with dishonest followers on GitHub. Please do not follow me just to unfollow later. Such actions will result in a block and a report for spam.
